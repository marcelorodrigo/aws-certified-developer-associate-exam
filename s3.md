# Simple Storage Service (S3)

- S3 is an *eventually consistent* system
- High Availability (automatically distributes your files to minimum 3 different physically availability zones)
- Buckets are private by default

## Buckets
- Defined at region level
- Naming Conventions
  - Global unique name
  - Must start with lower case letter or number
  - No uppercase
  - No underscore
  - 3~63 chars long
  - Not an IP

## Object Storage
- No hierarchy
- Max size is 5TB (but for uploading, multi-part is required in chunks of max 5GB)
- Metadata
- Tags (up to 10)

## Block Storage
- Data is stored in volumes and blocks where files are divided into blocks of same size
- Each block is addressed individually, but not metadata
- Example: 16kb file will be splitted into 4 blocks of 4kb
- This enables high I/O performance

## Versioning
Versioning enabled buckets allows you to:
- Recover a deleted object, because the object is not removed permanently (it's just hidden)
- Create a new version automatically when the object is overriden on the same bucket

## Encryption
Four encryption methods are available.

### SSE-S3
- Uses keys managed by AWS
- AES-256
- Must set header "x-amz-server-side-encryption": "AES256", when uploading

### SSE-KMS
- AWS Key Managament (KMS) manages encryption keys
- Gives you more control + audit trail
- Must set header "x-amz-server-side-encryption": "aws:kms", when uploading

### SSE-C
- When you want to manage your own encryption keys
- S3 doesn't store keys you provide
- HTTPS must be used
- Encryption key must be used on every request

### Client Side Encryption
- Encryption happens at the client side
- Client manages all lifecycle of encryption and decryption
