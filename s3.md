# Simple Storage Service (S3)

- S3 is an *eventually consistent* system
- High Availability (automatically distributes your files to minimum 3 different physically availability zones)
- Buckets are private by default

## Object Storage
- Treats data stored as an _Object_
- S3 does not care at all about data/content of your object
- S3 indeed cares about object metadata
- No hierarchy
- Should be used when you need highly durable/available storage system

## Block Storage
- Data is stored in volumes and blocks where files are divided into blocks of same size
- Each block is addressed individually, but not metadata
- Example: 16kb file will be splitted into 4 blocks of 4kb
- This enables high I/O performance
